The main goal of this project is to create a debt calculator that is able to determine how long a debt needs to be paid off.
The subgoal is to give the project the ability to grow into other financial areas.

Project Features include:
1. Uses 3 variables selected by user to return a new value (in this case the debt calculations)
2. Visualize data in a user friendly way (in this case, tables).
3. Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app (the foreign exchange currency to meet subgoal)
4. I have created some error handling in relation to user input, though I'm unsure if it includes every single situation.
	a. made all user entry sections required to use
	b. if user puts in an impossible request, then the app will alert them and also provide a suggestion in one scenario.

Future Plans:
I would like this project to eventually have multiple forms of calculations such as:
	1. Figuring out how much money to pay to pay off in a certain amount of months.
	2. Comparing 2 different payout options and the differences between them.
	etc.
I eventually want to add the API Key to server side instead of here, but I am unsure if I can finish that before the due date.

Other Note:
It sometimes takes a little time for the API to pull the data. I feel it takes even longer when you first run it, but I am unsure.
